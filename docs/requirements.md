Let me create a comprehensive requirements document for the Vitality System Character Builder application. This will help guide our development process and ensure we meet all the necessary functionality.

# Vitality System Character Builder - Requirements Document

## Project Overview
The Vitality System Character Builder is a web-based application designed to streamline the character creation process for the Vitality System roleplaying game. This application will help players create, manage, and share their characters while automatically handling complex calculations and rule validations.


## System Architecture
The application will use a modern three-tier architecture:
- Frontend: React-based single-page application providing an intuitive user interface
- Backend: .NET Web API handling business logic and data persistence
- Database: SQLite database storing character data and system rules

## Functional Requirements

### Character Creation and Management
The system must allow users to create characters following the Vitality System rules. This includes managing several interconnected aspects of character creation:

The character creation process must handle attribute calculations including:
- Combat Attributes (Focus, Power, Mobility, Endurance)
- Utility Attributes (Awareness, Communication, Intelligence)
- Derived statistics such as Health Pool, Movement Speed, and various combat scores
- Point allocation validation based on character tier

The system must support management of character abilities including:
- Special Attacks with associated limits and upgrades
- Unique Powers
- Expertise selections
- Features, Senses, and Descriptors

### Calculation and Validation Engine
The system must automatically handle complex rule calculations including:
- Point cost tracking for all character options
- Validation of prerequisites for abilities and powers
- Automatic calculation of derived statistics
- Verification that point allocations do not exceed allowed limits
- Tier-based progression requirements

### Data Management
The system must provide data persistence capabilities including:
- Saving character data to the database
- Loading existing characters
- Exporting characters to JSON format
- Sharing characters between users without requiring authentication

### Dice Rolling System
The system must include a dice rolling feature that supports:
- Standard d20 rolls
- Multiple d6 rolls
- Critical hit calculations
- Advantage/Disadvantage mechanics
- Display of roll results and modifiers

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- Responsive design that works on desktop browsers
- Intuitive interface for character creation and management
- Real-time calculation updates as users make choices
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Clear display of available points and costs
- Visual feedback for invalid selections

### Backend Requirements
- RESTful API endpoints for character data operations
- Robust validation logic for all character rules
- Efficient database queries and data management
- Error handling and logging
- JSON serialization for character data
- Stateless architecture for scalability

### Database Requirements
- Efficient schema design for character data
- Support for complex relationships between character elements
- Data integrity enforcement
- Support for future rule additions and modifications

## Performance Requirements
- Support for up to 8 concurrent users
- Response times under 2 seconds for all operations
- Database operations optimized for small dataset
- Efficient handling of character calculations
- Minimal server resource usage

## Security Requirements
- Basic input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- No authentication required
- Public access to all characters

## Deployment Requirements
- Simple deployment process
- Minimal server requirements
- Support for local hosting
- Easy backup and restore capabilities

## Development Guidelines
The development process should follow these principles:
- Code organization that mirrors the game system structure
- Clear separation of concerns between layers
- Comprehensive comments explaining complex game rules
- Modular design to support future additions
- Regular testing of calculation accuracy
- Version control usage
- Clean code practices

## Future Considerations
While not immediately required, the system should be designed to potentially accommodate:
- Additional rule supplements
- Character advancement tracking
- Combat simulation features
- Character optimization suggestions
- Print-friendly character sheet generation

## Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful when:
- Users can create valid characters following all system rules
- Calculations are accurate and reliable
- Character data can be saved and loaded
- The system is stable with multiple users
- The interface is intuitive for system veterans
- JSON export functionality works correctly
